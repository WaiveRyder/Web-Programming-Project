# BelayOn

[My Notes](notes.md)

An application to keep track of your gym's members to keep climbers climbing and staff moving.

## 🚀 Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

As climbing moves to the forefront of sports, the demand for climbing gyms has increased dramatically. With more and more climbers moving indoors the systems of yesterday to track and manage guest and members are no longer adequet. BelayOn solves these problems by using modern web tools and techniques to help you manage your gym more effectively, allowing your climbers a seamless transition from guest to member. Improved productivity for your staff also allows them to focus more on customer relations, facilities managment, safety, and instruction overall improving the quality of life for everyone in the gym. 

### Design

![Design image](BelayOnDraft.jpeg)

First page will be a login page, allowing employees access to the system. Logging in will pull up the list of all guests and members with some information about each. Clicking on a name will pull up a small window with more detailed information and the ability to view their membership status and notes. All of these will have buttons and options to edit on the fly.

### Key features

- One-Click Member: Allow easy transition from Guest to Member in 1 click.
- Robust Notes: Ability to add notes to account and view deleted notes to keep staff aware of context with accounts.
- Linked Accounts: Families are easily accessed and modified together, rather than needing to edit each account separately.
- Checkout System: Prevent mix ups by making sure only 1 staff member can modify an account at a time.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Provide a structure to the website ensuring users can find what they need. Two pages, one for logging in and one for displaying the guests and members. A smaller popup window will be needed to display more info of the guests.
- **CSS** - By creating a smooth workflow through efficient and pleasing to look at site. Scaling on different screen sizes, using smoother edges and bright colors will allow for a modern sleek design.
- **React** - React will make the webpage interactable for users to login, make edits to accounts, show other users working on accounts, and showing the list of guests/members.
- **Service** - Allow users to access accounts from anywhere. Retrieves member's and guest's data, edits from the user to be saved, current editing from other users, logging in and signing up, and retreiving motivation quotes from [ZenQuotes](https://zenquotes.io?api=today)
- **DB/Login** - Ensure only certified users can make edits to the system and store guest and member accounts/details.
- **WebSocket** - Prevent users from editing the same account and overriding eachother's work. Shows which accounts are locked because other users are currently editing them.
